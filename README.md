# Third Assignment RegEx 📚

Welcome to your third assignment in the Advanced Programming course! In this assignment, you will be working with regular expressions (RegEx) and combining them with Java syntax. The assignment consists of three problems designed to help you learn and practice using regular expressions effectively.

## Getting Started 🚀

To get started with this assignment, you need to Fork this repository and clone the fork to your local machine. The repository contains the problem statements, source files, and unit tests.

Ensure to enable workflows in the `Actions` tab of your fork of the repository. This will allow GitHub to run the provided test cases.

## Prerequisites ✅

Before attempting this assignment, make sure you have the following:

1. Basic knowledge of Java programming language.
2. Understanding of regular expressions and their syntax.
3. Familiarity with Git for version control.

## Evaluation 📃

To successfully complete this assignment, you need to meet the following requirements:

1. Ensure your code compiles and runs without any errors.
2. Pass all the unit tests provided in the `src/test/java` directory.
3. Organize your code in a clear and readable manner. Use proper indentation and follow clean code principles.
4. Add comments to explain your code and make it easier to understand.

Remember to use Git for version control throughout the assignment. Commit your changes frequently and provide meaningful commit messages to track your progress.

**Note: It is strictly prohibited to use ChatGPT or any other AI generative model for completing any section of this assignment. Failure to comply will result in a score of 0 without any warnings.**

## Notes 📝

Here are some important points to keep in mind for this assignment:

- You are required to solve the first three problems. The fourth problem is a bonus problem and is relatively more challenging than the others.
- To solve problems 3 and 4, it is necessary to understand the concept of "backreferencing" in regular expressions. Make sure you have a good understanding of this concept before attempting these problems.
- It's worth mentioning you are free to use ChatGPT or any other AI generative model in order to learn topics that you can not find suitable resources for on the internet.
